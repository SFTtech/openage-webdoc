If you're a first-time commiter, add yourself to the above list. This is not
just for legal reasons, but also to keep an overview of all those nicknames.

If your info is missing, wrong, or you want it to be removed for whatever
reason, please contact us.

A full list of all nyan authors ("contributors") can also be determined
from the VCS, e.g. via `git shortlog -sne`, or conveniently looked up on
[the GitHub web interface](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan/graphs/contributors).

Details on individual authorships of files can be obtained via the VCS,
e.g. via `git blame`, or the GitHub web interface.

If you wish to include a file from nyan in your project, make sure to
include all required legal info. The easiest way to do this would probably
be to include a copy of this file (`copying.md`), and to leave the file's
copyright header untouched.

Per-file license header guidelines:

In addition to this file, to prevent legal caveats, every source file *must*
include a header.

**nyan-native** source files, that is, files that were created by
_the nyan authors_, require the following one-line header, preferrably in
the first line, as a comment:

    Copyright 20XX-20YY the nyan authors, LGPLv3+. See copying.md for legal info.

`20XX` is the year when the file was created, and `20YY` is the year when
the file was last edited. When editing a file, make sure the
last-modification year is still correct.


Notes about this file:

This file originates from [openage](https://openage.sft.mx/).
It was adapted for nyan and its license.

I (zuntrax) and neither mic_e are lawyers. This is an open-source
project, we're doing this for fun. People convinced me that this legal
shit must be done, so I did it, even though I'd rather have spent the
time on useful parts of the project.  If you see any legal issues,
feel free to contact me.  I, personally, despise in-sourcefile legal
text blocks. They're a pest, and unlike many others, I don't simply
accept them because "that is what everybody does". Thus, I worked out
the minimal 1-line text above, which should be free of legal caveats,
and a reasonable compromise.  I'd be happy to see it used in other
projects; you're free to use this file (`copying.md`) as a template
for your project's legal documentation.
