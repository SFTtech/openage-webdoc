Basic Installation
------------------

.. note::

    The following instructions will install a packaged version of openage
    on your computer.


Linux Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide packages for different Linux distributions. Please take a
look for distribution packages at `Repology <https://repology.org/project/openage/packages>`_


Windows Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide an installer package for Windows 64-bit versions. The latest 
release installer you find at `Github <https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/releases>`_


macOS Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Running openage on macOS worked in the past, and might or might not work right now.

Setting up continuous integration for this platform has some complications. Running a
hackintosh VM seems to be not so legal, while buying dedicated hardware for it seems to
be not so cheap. If you know of a legal and cost-free way of doing so or want to sponsor
a semi-recent Mac Mini, please open a ticket in our issue tracker. Until then, PRs untested
on macOS will make their way into the master branch and occasional breakage will occur.
